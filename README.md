## Introduction

My solutions to problems on Leetcode.

## History

* 2017.1.21 Finished most of the problems with difficulty 'Easy' in algorithm.

> The initial purpose of working on these problems was to strengthen my comprehension on Data Structure, but later I found that algorithms are interesting as well, so I spent some extra time on easiest algorithms.

I tend to rest for a while to learn something more before I can continue with more complex problems on DS and ALG :)
